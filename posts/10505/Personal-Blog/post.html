            <h1>Dalgona Coffee</h1>
            <h3>So fluffy. So creamy.</h3>
            <h6>

            </h6>
            <p><u>Dalgona coffee</u> it started as a Tik Tok trend and has now exploded all over the internet as the It-Drink of the moment. Is it worth the hype? Only one way to find out.</p>
            <blockquote>If you've got instant coffee, sugar, and water on hand, you can make this. It'll go by faster if you have a hand mixer, but a humble regular whisk, one powerful arm, and a good dose of patience and endurance will get you there tooâ€”just make sure you're ready to feel the burn in your triceps and biceps and you'll be rewarded with a nice tall glass of cold, creamy coffee that's sweetened just right. Depending on how much of a caffeine rush you want, this recipe makes enough dalgona fluff for one or two servings. It's delicious but very strong: drink at your own discretion!</blockquote>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tbsp. granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 tbsp. instant coffee</li>
                <li>2 tbsp. cold water</li>
                <li>Ice, for serving</li>
                <li>Milk, for serving</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium bowl, combine sugar, coffee, and water. Using a hand mixer or a whisk, vigorously whisk until mixture turns silky smooth and shiny, then continue whisking until it thickens and holds its lofty, foamy shape. (If whisking by hand, it will take 8 to 12 minutes to get to optimal fluffiness.)</li>
                <li>Fill a glass most of the way full with ice and milk, then dollop and swirl the whipped coffee mixture on top, mixing before drinking, if desired.</li>
            </ol>
